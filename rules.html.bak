    <p class="mb-4">Ambition is a gamified productivity app where you earn points by completing tasks, set goals, and stay motivated. Here’s how it works:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
      <li><strong>Tasks</strong>: Add tasks with a category, optional Urgent/Important flags, and notes.</li>
      <li><strong>Categories & Points</strong>:
      	<ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
            <li><strong>Relevant (5 points)</strong>: Tasks directly tied to your core goals or priorities, such as advancing a key project or personal objective.</li>
            <li><strong>Other (3 points)</strong>: Tasks that contribute to your goals but are less critical, like secondary activities or exploratory work.</li>
            <li><strong>Chores (2 points)</strong>: Routine household or maintenance tasks, such as cleaning, grocery shopping, or organizing.</li>
            <li><strong>People (5 points)</strong>: Activities that build or maintain relationships, like spending time with family, networking, or supporting friends.</li>
            <li><strong>Backlog (5 points)</strong>: Tasks deferred from previous plans that need completion, such as clearing overdue work or addressing pending items.</li>
            <li><strong>Abspielen(Leisure) (1 point)</strong>: Relaxing or recreational activities that recharge you, like watching a movie, gaming, or hobbies.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Bonuses</strong>: +4 points for Urgent, +4 for Important (e.g., Relevant + Urgent = 9 points).</li>
      <li><strong>Goals</strong>: Set main goals to guide your tasks.</li>
      <li><strong>Backlog Decay</strong>: Tasks move to Backlog (5 points) after a set number of days (configurable in Settings).</li>
      <li><strong>Points Tracking</strong>: Lifetime Points and daily scores update on task completion. Progress bar fills to 1000 points.</li>
      <li><strong>Data</strong>: Tasks and goals are stored in your browser’s localStorage, so they’re private to your device.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Complete tasks, earn points, and level up your productivity!</p>
